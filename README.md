👋 Hey, I’m Hasan Rashid
💻 Datamatiker student @ KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology)
🚀 Passionate about building tech that actually makes sense for people
🛠️ Currently building a mobile app that makes Danish politics more transparent using vector search + AI

💡 About Me
I'm a developer who enjoys solving real-world problems through clean code, smart design, and collaboration. I love working across the full stack — from frontend to backend, databases, CI/CD, and deployment. Whether it's writing Java in Spring or designing a friendly React Native UI, I'm in my element.

I believe the best solutions come from a good understanding of the whole process: idea → design → build → deploy.

⚙️ Tech I'm working with
Languages:
Java, JavaScript, Python

Frameworks & Libraries:
Spring Boot, React Native, Node.js, JUnit

Databases:
MySQL, Firebase, Supabase (PostgreSQL), pgvector

DevOps & Tools:
Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Maven, Azure

Methodologies:
Agile development, Scrum, CI/CD pipelines, UML modeling

📱 Current Project
🗳️ Folketinget Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
An app that makes Danish parliamentary votes searchable by meaning, not just keywords.

Built with React Native, styled for a clean user experience

Filter votes by party, type, or result

Uses OpenAI embeddings + pgvector to implement semantic search

Goal: make politics more accessible and transparent through smarter tech

Why just read laws when you can actually find the ones that matter to you? 😉
